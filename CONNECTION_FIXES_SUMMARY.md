# Connection Issues Fixed

## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Issue 1: Information Flow Arrow from Kanban Post to Production Control
**Problem**: The ConnectorCreationHandler was excluding 'materialConnector' types from connections, but this was too broad and prevented Material Flow/Material Push arrows from connecting to supermarkets.

**Root Cause**: The `_isConnectableItem` method in ConnectorCreationHandler excluded all 'materialConnector' types.

**Fix**: Updated the exclusion list to only exclude 'kanbanLoop' and 'withdrawalLoop' types:
```dart
bool _isConnectableItem(String itemType) {
  const excludedTypes = {
    'kanbanLoop',
    'withdrawalLoop',
  };
  return !excludedTypes.contains(itemType);
}
```

### Issue 2: Material Flow Arrow from Shipping to Supermarket
**Problem**: The connection logic was checking both `_connectorCreationHandler.isConnecting` AND the connectionMode, but there was a timing issue where the ConnectorCreationHandler state wasn't properly synchronized.

**Root Cause**: Race condition between setState() and ConnectorCreationHandler initialization.

**Fix**: Simplified the condition to check if we're in the right connection mode and using a valid connector type:
```dart
// Before (problematic):
if (_connectorCreationHandler.isConnecting && _canConnectItem('process', currentConnectorType))

// After (fixed):
if (_isValidConnectorType(currentConnectorType) && _canConnectItem('process', currentConnectorType))
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `lib/utils/connector_creation_handler.dart`
- Removed 'materialConnector' from excluded types to allow Material Flow/Push connections to supermarkets

### 2. `lib/screens/process_canvas_screen.dart`
Updated all selection methods to use simplified condition logic:
- `_selectProcess()`
- `_selectCustomerDataBox()`  
- `_selectSupplierDataBox()`
- `_selectProductionControlDataBox()`
- `_selectTruckDataBox()`
- `_selectKanbanPost()`
- `_selectMaterialConnector()`
- `_selectConnectionHandle()`

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### Information Flow Arrows
✅ **Kanban Post → Production Control**: Should now work with common connection routine
✅ **Any basic entity → Any basic entity**: All combinations should work

### Material Flow Arrows  
✅ **Shipping → Supermarket**: Should now work with common connection routine
✅ **Any entity → Material Connectors**: Should work for Material Flow and Material Push
✅ **Process → Supermarket**: Should work
✅ **Truck → FIFO/Buffer**: Should work

### Connection Workflow
1. Select connector type (Information/Electronic/Material Flow/Material Push)
2. Click supplier item → Shows connection handles
3. Select supplier handle → Prompts for customer
4. Click customer item → Shows connection handles  
5. Select customer handle → Creates connection

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Test Kanban Post → Production Control** with Information Flow Arrow
2. **Test Shipping → Supermarket** with Material Flow Arrow
3. **Test other combinations** to ensure no regressions:
   - Process → Process (Information/Electronic)
   - Process → Data Box (all types)
   - Data Box → Data Box (all types)
   - Any entity → Material Connectors (Material Flow/Push only)

The fixes maintain backward compatibility with special workflows (Kanban Loops, Withdrawal Loops, Material Connector creation) while enabling the common connection routine for all standard connector types.
