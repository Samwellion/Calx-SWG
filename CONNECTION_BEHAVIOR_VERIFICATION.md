# Connection Behavior Verification

## Expected Connection Behaviors

### Information Flow Arrow ✅
- ✅ Kanban Post → Production Control (basic entity to basic entity)
- ✅ Process → Process 
- ✅ Data Box → Data Box
- ❌ Should NOT connect to Material Connectors (they have separate info flows via Kanban/Withdrawal loops)

### Electronic Information Flow Arrow ✅
- ✅ Same as Information Flow Arrow
- ❌ Should NOT connect to Material Connectors

### Material Flow Arrow ✅
- ✅ Shipping → Supermarket (basic entity to material connector - for shipping connections)
- ✅ Process → Supermarket (any basic entity to material connector)
- ✅ Process → Process (basic entity to basic entity)
- ✅ Truck → FIFO (shipping to material connector)

### Material Push Arrow ✅
- ✅ Same as Material Flow Arrow

### Special Workflows (Preserved) ✅
- ✅ **Kanban Loop**: Supermarket → Supplier Process/Kanban Post
- ✅ **Withdrawal Loop**: Customer Process → Supermarket  
- ✅ **Material Connector Placement**: Supplier Process → Customer Process (creates material connector between them)

## Current Implementation Status

Based on the fixes made:

1. **ConnectorCreationHandler** now allows all item types except kanbanLoop/withdrawalLoop
2. **Material connectors** can be TARGETS of Material Flow/Push connections
3. **Basic entities** can connect to each other with any connector type
4. **Special workflows** are preserved for their specific purposes

## Testing Checklist

### Information Flow Connections
- [ ] Kanban Post → Production Control  
- [ ] Process → Process
- [ ] Data Box → Kanban Post

### Material Flow Connections  
- [ ] Shipping Process → Supermarket
- [ ] Truck Data Box → FIFO
- [ ] Process → Buffer
- [ ] Any Basic Entity → Any Material Connector

### Verify Special Workflows Still Work
- [ ] Material Connector Creation (Process → Process)
- [ ] Kanban Loop (Supermarket → Supplier)
- [ ] Withdrawal Loop (Customer → Supermarket)

The key distinction is:
- **Standard connectors** (Info/Electronic/Material Flow/Push) use the **common connection routine**
- **Special workflows** (Material placement, Kanban/Withdrawal loops) use **dedicated workflows**
- **Material connectors** can be **targets** of Material Flow/Push but are **created** via special placement workflow
