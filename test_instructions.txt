Test the input field behavior:

1. Create a FIFO connector between "Picking and Kitting" and "Sole Assembly"
2. Click on the input field that shows "0"
3. Type "1" - should show "1"
4. Type "0" - should show "10"  
5. Type "0" - should show "100"
6. Type "0" - should show "1000"

Expected result: All digits should appear in sequence without any disappearing.

Current fixes applied:
- Removed custom NumberWithCommasFormatter completely
- Using Flutter's built-in FilteringTextInputFormatter.digitsOnly
- No cursor manipulation
- Simple onChanged handler that just parses the text

Position fix applied:
- Connector positioned at midpoint between processes 
- Y offset of +100px below process centers
- Should appear BETWEEN processes, not on top of them
